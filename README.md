A DIY motorcycle project

This project is to keep track of a two wheel drive electric motorcycle.

The end design will hopefully look like the motorcycle in the anime movie [https://goo.gl/NvuFUL](Akira).

I am not a mechanical engineer and input from the community on both frame design and motor control code will be helpful.

This project will be using a real-time operating system and possible be coded in Rust.

Enjoy!
